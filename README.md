This image shows the raw Json display. This [Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa) formats the Json for a rational display.

The following two images show the project's two HTML pages. An HTML page is used instead of an ASPX page to illustrate that Ajax, not ASP.NET, is loading the data.

## Using Ajax requires an HTTP endpoint

Later versions of C# offers a Web API framework that creates HTTP endpoints. AVR doesn't support the Web API but with the little effort you can create an HTTP ending with a "Generic Handler." Generic handlers have the ASHX file extension. 

![](https://nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/asna-assets/assets/articles/generic-handler.webp)

For this example project, the `customerlist.ashx`  file in the `services` folder provides the generic handler for its Ajax services. This hander provides an HTTP endpoint at:

```
/services/customerlist.ashx
```

The 'ashx' file itself dosn't provide any code. Its source is just this one line: 

```
<%@ WebHandler Language="AVR" class="CustomerList" CodeBehind="CustomerList.ashx.vr" %>
```

This line points assigns the `CustomerList` class in the [`CustomerList.ashx.vr`](https://github.com/ASNA/AjaxExample2025/blob/main/WorkWithAjax/App_Code/CustomerList.ashx.vr) file as the handler for the HTTP endpoint. That file is in the `App_Code` folder. (the `.ashx` part of the extension isn't necessary; it's a convention to help identify this file as a HTTP handler; )

`CustomerList.ashx.vr` uses the `CustomerByNameListService`  in the `CustomerByNameListService.vr`  file to do the initial processing to fetch DataGate data, as shown below:

    ListByName = *New CustomerByNameListService()
    context.Response.ContentType = ListByName.ContentType
    Output = ListByName.GetAutoCompleteResponse(StartingKey)
    context.Response.Write(Output)

The `CustomerByNameListService` uses the `VPS.DataNavagationServices.CustomerByNameList` to connect to DataGate and fetch the data.

The `context.Response.Write(output)` is what emits the HTTP response--which in this case is a Json document with a list of customers in it.  In this case, two fields are returned: the CMName field is identified as `label` and the CMCustNo field is identified as `value`.  This data was intended for an autocomplete and it was originally intended to populate `LI` tags in a `SELECT` tag. 

```
{
    "label": "A Y Service C Associate",
    "value": "70400"
},
```

In `SimpleAjaxCall.html` JavaScript's native `fetch` reads the response from `apiUrl` provided. Two arguments: `order` and `startingKey` are passed to the HTTP endpoint and passed to the AVR logic in `

    var apiUrl = `/services/customerlist.ashx?order=name&startingkey=${customerName}`;
    
    try {
        const response = await fetch(apiUrl);
    ...
